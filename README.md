# Salary-Bar-Chart
Drawing a bar chart of individuals’ highest salaries using the Turtle library

Using the csv library, a CSV file containing individuals’ first names, last names, and a series of salary values is opened and read. For each person, the highest salary is identified and stored. Then, using the Turtle library, a visual bar chart is drawn with each person’s first and last name, where each bar represents an individual’s highest salary.
You need to install the turtle and csv libraries for this code.
This code is useful for those who want to begin working with Turtle.
